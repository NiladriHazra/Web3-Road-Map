# Web3 Developer Roadmap# Web3-Road-Map



Your no-BS guide to becoming a Web3 developer. I've spent hours researching and curating the best resources so you don't have to wade through garbage content.

Welcome to the  Web3 Roadmap !. I have curated the best articles and resources to create an Excalidraw sheet, offering you a structured and comprehensive way to learn Web3 development.

## What This Is

## Introduction

This is a visual roadmap (Excalidraw diagram) that shows you exactly what to learn and in what order. No fluff, no endless lists of random tutorials. Just a clear path from "I know JavaScript" to "I can build dApps."

This project is designed to help you learn Web3 development through a documented approach. The resources and articles compiled here provide a step-by-step guide to mastering various aspects of Web3 technology. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find valuable information to enhance your skills.

## Why I Made This

## How to Use

Because most Web3 learning resources suck. They either:

- Assume you already know everything1. **Explore the Roadmap**: Navigate through the roadmap sections to find curated articles and resources for each topic.

- Throw 50 technologies at you with no context2. **Read and Learn**: Follow the documented approach to read and understand the materials provided.

- Are outdated as hell (looking at you, Truffle tutorials from 2019)3. **Practice**: Implement the concepts through hands-on practice and projects.

- Skip the fundamentals and jump straight to advanced concepts4. **Excalidraw Sheet**: Use the Excalidraw sheet to visualize and organize your learning process.



This roadmap fixes that. It's structured, up-to-date, and actually explains *why* you need to learn each thing.## Syllabus



## What You'll LearnFor the detailed syllabus, please refer to the [Syllabus.md](https://github.com/vignesh-chaturvedi/100xDevs-Web3-Roadmap/blob/main/Syllabus.md) file.



### 1. **Blockchain Fundamentals** (Don't skip this)## Contribution Guidelines

   - How blockchains actually work (hashing, consensus, nodes)

   - Bitcoin vs Ethereum architectureWe welcome contributions to improve and expand this roadmap. Here’s how you can contribute:

   - What the hell is gas and why it matters

   - Public vs private keys (if you don't get this, you'll get rekt)1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Open the Master File**: Navigate to the `Master_File.excalidraw` file and open it in the [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) website.

### 2. **Ethereum Development**3. **Update/Make Changes**: Make your updates and changes to the Excalidraw sheet as needed.

   - Solidity (the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts)4. **Push and Create a Pull Request**: Push your changes to your forked repository and then raise a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository.

   - Smart contract patterns and best practices   **Please include a screenshot of the changes you have made in your pull request description.**

   - Common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow, etc.)

   - Testing your contracts (seriously, don't deploy untested code)Please ensure that your contributions adhere to the overall structure and format of the roadmap.



### 3. **Development Tools**## Support

   - Hardhat/Foundry (modern dev environments - pick one)

   - Remix IDE (good for learning, not for production)If you find this project helpful, please give it a star! ⭐ Enjoy your learning journey!

   - MetaMask and wallet integration

   - Alchemy/Infura (node providers)You can also support my work by [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/lazyvim).



### 4. **Frontend Integration**## Example SS:

   - Web3.js vs Ethers.js (use Ethers, trust me)![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eb57f12-cb0f-4d98-b153-75c934e0023e)

   - Connecting wallets to your dApp
   - Reading from and writing to smart contracts
   - Handling transactions and errors

### 5. **Advanced Concepts**
   - ERC standards (ERC-20 tokens, ERC-721 NFTs, ERC-1155)
   - Oracles (Chainlink)
   - Layer 2 solutions (Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism)
   - IPFS and decentralized storage
   - Subgraph/The Graph for querying blockchain data

### 6. **Security & Best Practices**
   - Auditing basics
   - Common attack vectors
   - Gas optimization
   - Upgradeable contracts (proxies)

## Prerequisites

You need to know:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** (not negotiable)
- **React** (or another frontend framework)
- **Git and command line basics**
- **How APIs work**

If you're missing any of these, go learn them first. Web3 is hard enough without struggling with basic programming concepts.

## How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Open the Excalidraw file** - This is where the actual roadmap lives with all the resources
2. **Follow the path** - The diagram shows dependencies (what to learn before what)
3. **Don't skip around** - Seriously, follow the order. I've structured it so each concept builds on the previous ones
4. **Build projects** - After each section, build something. Theory is useless without practice
5. **Join communities** - Web3 moves fast. Get on Twitter, Discord, and follow the right people

## Time Commitment

Be realistic:
- **Blockchain basics**: 1-2 weeks
- **Solidity fundamentals**: 2-3 weeks
- **First working dApp**: 1-2 months
- **Job-ready**: 4-6 months of consistent work

Anyone selling you a "learn Web3 in 30 days" course is lying.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Jumping into complex projects too early** - Build simple stuff first
2. **Ignoring security** - Your code will handle real money. Take this seriously
3. **Not testing on testnets** - Use Goerli, Sepolia, or Mumbai before mainnet
4. **Following outdated tutorials** - Web3 changes fast. Check the date on everything
5. **Trying to learn everything at once** - Focus on one thing at a time

## Resources I Actually Recommend

**Documentation (Read these, they're actually good):**
- Ethereum.org docs
- Solidity docs
- Ethers.js docs
- OpenZeppelin contracts

**YouTube Channels (Actually good ones):**
- Patrick Collins (seriously, this guy is a legend)
- Smart Contract Programmer
- Dapp University (older but solid)

**Practice:**
- CryptoZombies (gamified Solidity learning)
- Ethernaut (security challenges)
- Speedrun Ethereum (build real projects)

## Contributing

Found a broken link? Better resource? See something outdated?

1. Fork this repo
2. Open `Master_File.excalidraw` in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)
3. Make your changes
4. Screenshot what you changed
5. Submit a PR with the screenshot

**Rules:**
- Only suggest resources you've actually used
- No affiliate links
- Keep it structured and organized
- Update dates/versions if suggesting new tools

## A Reality Check

Web3 is overhyped, but the technology is real. You won't get rich quick. Most projects fail. The job market is volatile.

BUT - if you genuinely find blockchain technology interesting and want to build in this space, this roadmap will get you there.

Good luck. You'll need it.
