# Web3-Road-Map



Your no-BS guide to becoming a Web3 developer. I've spent hours researching and curating the best resources so you don't have to wade through garbage content.






A visual roadmap (Excalidraw diagram) that shows you exactly what to learn and in what order. No fluff, no endless lists of random tutorials. Just a clear path from "I know JavaScript" to "I can build dApps."Welcome to the  Web3 Roadmap !. I have curated the best articles and resources to create an Excalidraw sheet, offering you a structured and comprehensive way to learn Web3 development.

## Introduction



Because most Web3 learning resources suck. They either:This is a visual roadmap (Excalidraw diagram) that shows you exactly what to learn and in what order. No fluff, no endless lists of random tutorials. Just a clear path from "I know JavaScript" to "I can build dApps."

- Assume you already know everything

- Throw 50 technologies at you with no contextThis project is designed to help you learn Web3 development through a documented approach. The resources and articles compiled here provide a step-by-step guide to mastering various aspects of Web3 technology. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you'll find valuable information to enhance your skills.

- Are outdated as hell (Truffle tutorials from 2019)

- Skip the fundamentals and jump straight to advanced concepts## Why I Made This



This roadmap fixes that. It's structured, up-to-date, and actually explains *why* you need to learn each thing.## How to Use



## What You'll LearnBecause most Web3 learning resources suck. They either:



### 1. Blockchain Fundamentals- Assume you already know everything1. **Explore the Roadmap**: Navigate through the roadmap sections to find curated articles and resources for each topic.

- How blockchains actually work (hashing, consensus, nodes)

- Bitcoin vs Ethereum architecture- Throw 50 technologies at you with no context2. **Read and Learn**: Follow the documented approach to read and understand the materials provided.

- What gas is and why it matters

- Public vs private keys (if you don't get this, you'll get rekt)- Are outdated as hell (looking at you, Truffle tutorials from 2019)3. **Practice**: Implement the concepts through hands-on practice and projects.



### 2. Ethereum Development- Skip the fundamentals and jump straight to advanced concepts4. **Excalidraw Sheet**: Use the Excalidraw sheet to visualize and organize your learning process.

- Solidity (smart contract programming language)

- Smart contract patterns and best practices

- Common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow, etc.)

- Testing contracts (don't deploy untested code)This roadmap fixes that. It's structured, up-to-date, and actually explains *why* you need to learn each thing.## Syllabus



### 3. Development Tools

- Hardhat/Foundry (modern dev environments)

- Remix IDE (good for learning)## What You'll LearnFor the detailed syllabus, please refer to the [Syllabus.md](https://github.com/vignesh-chaturvedi/100xDevs-Web3-Roadmap/blob/main/Syllabus.md) file.

- MetaMask and wallet integration

- Alchemy/Infura (node providers)



### 4. Frontend Integration

### 1. **Blockchain Fundamentals** (Don't skip this)

## Contribution Guidelines

- Web3.js vs Ethers.js (use Ethers)

- Connecting wallets to your dApp   - How blockchains actually work (hashing, consensus, nodes)

- Reading from and writing to smart contracts

- Handling transactions and errors   - Bitcoin vs Ethereum architectureWe welcome contributions to improve and expand this roadmap. Here‚Äôs how you can contribute:



### 5. Advanced Concepts   - What the hell is gas and why it matters

- ERC standards (ERC-20 tokens, ERC-721 NFTs, ERC-1155)

- Oracles (Chainlink)   - Public vs private keys (if you don't get this, you'll get rekt)1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.

- Layer 2 solutions (Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism)

- IPFS and decentralized storage2. **Open the Master File**: Navigate to the `Master_File.excalidraw` file and open it in the [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) website.

- The Graph for querying blockchain data

### 2. **Ethereum Development**3. **Update/Make Changes**: Make your updates and changes to the Excalidraw sheet as needed.

### 6. Security & Best Practices

- Auditing basics   - Solidity (the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts)4. **Push and Create a Pull Request**: Push your changes to your forked repository and then raise a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository.

- Common attack vectors

- Gas optimization   - Smart contract patterns and best practices   **Please include a screenshot of the changes you have made in your pull request description.**

- Upgradeable contracts (proxies)

   - Common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow, etc.)

## Prerequisites

   - Testing your contracts (seriously, don't deploy untested code)Please ensure that your contributions adhere to the overall structure and format of the roadmap.

You need to know:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript** (not negotiable)

- **React** (or another frontend framework)

- **Git and command line basics**### 3. **Development Tools**## Support

- **How APIs work**

   - Hardhat/Foundry (modern dev environments - pick one)

If you're missing any of these, go learn them first. Web3 is hard enough without struggling with basic programming concepts.

   - Remix IDE (good for learning, not for production)If you find this project helpful, please give it a star! ‚≠ê Enjoy your learning journey!

## How to Use This Roadmap

   - MetaMask and wallet integration

1. **Open the [Excalidraw file](https://excalidraw.com/#json=U8y1RGjo_ONJB96VgrOql,hRKEgq7z6k3FK-6NUivERQ)** - This is where the actual roadmap lives with all the resources

2. **Check the [Syllabus](./Syllabus.md)** - Week-by-week breakdown of what to learn   - Alchemy/Infura (node providers)You can also support my work by [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/lazyvim).

3. **Follow the path** - Don't skip around. Each concept builds on previous ones

4. **Build projects** - After each section, build something. Theory without practice is useless

5. **Join communities** - Web3 moves fast. Get on Twitter, Discord, follow the right people

### 4. **Frontend Integration**## Example SS:

## Time Commitment

   - Web3.js vs Ethers.js (use Ethers, trust me)![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eb57f12-cb0f-4d98-b153-75c934e0023e)

Be realistic:

- **Blockchain basics**: 1-2 weeks   - Connecting wallets to your dApp

- **Solidity fundamentals**: 2-3 weeks   - Reading from and writing to smart contracts

- **First working dApp**: 1-2 months   - Handling transactions and errors

- **Job-ready**: 4-6 months of consistent work

### 5. **Advanced Concepts**

Anyone selling you a "learn Web3 in 30 days" course is lying.   - ERC standards (ERC-20 tokens, ERC-721 NFTs, ERC-1155)

   - Oracles (Chainlink)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid   - Layer 2 solutions (Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism)

   - IPFS and decentralized storage

1. **Jumping into complex projects too early** - Build simple stuff first   - Subgraph/The Graph for querying blockchain data

2. **Ignoring security** - Your code will handle real money

3. **Not testing on testnets** - Use Sepolia or Holesky before mainnet### 6. **Security & Best Practices**

4. **Following outdated tutorials** - Check the date on everything   - Auditing basics

5. **Trying to learn everything at once** - Focus on one thing at a time   - Common attack vectors

   - Gas optimization

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Rules:**

- Only suggest resources you've actually used1. **Jumping into complex projects too early** - Build simple stuff first

- No affiliate links2. **Ignoring security** - Your code will handle real money. Take this seriously

- Keep it structured and organized3. **Not testing on testnets** - Use Goerli, Sepolia, or Mumbai before mainnet

- Update dates/versions if suggesting new tools4. **Following outdated tutorials** - Web3 changes fast. Check the date on everything

5. **Trying to learn everything at once** - Focus on one thing at a time

## A Reality Check

## Resources I Actually Recommend

Web3 is overhyped, but the technology is real. You won't get rich quick. Most projects fail. The job market is volatile.

**Documentation (Read these, they're actually good):**

BUT - if you genuinely find blockchain technology interesting and want to build in this space, this roadmap will get you there.- Ethereum.org docs

- Solidity docs

Good luck. You'll need it.- Ethers.js docs

- OpenZeppelin contracts
